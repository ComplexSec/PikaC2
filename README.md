> [!IMPORTANT]  
> PikaC2 is a labour of love created by an inexperienced developer to better understand how C2's function and operate. This is not meant to be a replacement of your current C2. It will be coming soon!

> [!CAUTION]
> PikaC2 is still in early development. Bugs and unexpected errors/problems may arise during use. These will be remedied in future patches and updates as the framework matures.

### Quick Start

> Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/ComplexSec/PikaC2/wiki) for complete documentation.

PikaC2 works well on Debian 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 and Kali Linux. It's recommended to use the latest versions possible to avoid issues. You'll need a modern version of Qt and Python 3.10.x to avoid build issues.

See the [Installation](https://github.com/ComplexSec/PikaC2/wiki#installation) guide in the Wiki for instructions. If you run into issues, check the [Known Issues](https://github.com/ComplexSec/PikaC2/wiki#known-issues) page as well as the open/closed [Issues](https://github.com/ComplexSec/PikaC2/issues) list.
