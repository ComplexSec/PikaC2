> [!IMPORTANT]  
> PikaC2 is a labour of love created by an inexperienced developer to better understand how C2's function and operate. This is not meant to be a replacement of your current C2. It will be coming soon!

> [!CAUTION]
> PikaC2 is still in early development. Bugs and unexpected errors/problems may arise during use. These will be remedied in future patches and updates as the framework matures.
